<h1>unFailing Harder</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago I went to the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23unfailconf">#unfailconf at the Dublin Science Gallery</a>. Lots of fun was had; too much to reiterate here, but there was one thing in particular that I wanted to write about: I met David, who was kind enough to share his experience develping <a href="http://algebalance.com/">his iOS application <em>Algebalance</em></a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/algebalance/id662409244?ls=1&amp;mt=8">available on the iOS App Store</a>).</p>

<p>Algebalance is a game for iOS that is designed to be fun and teach children a thing or two about basic algebra: resolving terms using the good ol' scales analogon. The game starts out with simple puzzles based on that premise and gradually becomes more challenging. It's fun, cute, swift and I'd totally buy it for my kids. There's also a short demo on YouTube, so you get to enjoy some hands-on pretty pictures like we did during David's talk:</p>

<p>The concept is solid, the gameplay is fluid, designers were hired for the graphics and they turned out beautifully, the BGM was composed by a professional and the whole game has a nice, polished look to it. David obviously put a lot of effort into this...</p>
<h1>So, What's the Problem?</h1>
<p>... turns out, hard work and great specs aren't the only thing you need to make a game sell great. You also need that obnoxious thing called 'marketing', which is not exactly a strong suit with most engineers. As a result, from what David told us, sales haven't exactly been... stellar. Even with a handful of good reviews, some well-placed ads in local newspapers and a few solid publicity stunts. Considering all the work that went into this, that is quite sad, but it does ring familiar as it is. So, in a way it was nice to hear that, since I'm having quite the same problem with my own application and I'm certain a lot of other, aspiring app developers can relate to this as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately David didn't seem to be too distraught about it: from what I gather he'll be concentrating on writing more games, but quite possibly a bit smaller in scale. Possibly with a different marketing strategy. It also turns out, that, talking about issues like these at an unconference may lead to marketing students willing to help out to brush up on their skills as a class project. And that can only mean good things, right?</p>
<p>So, what did I - and hopefully others - take away from this? Don't give up, hang in there, keep rocking, and most importantly: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/algebalance/id662409244?ls=1&amp;mt=8">grab a copy of Algebalance on the iOS App Store</a>! ;)</p>
