# Synthetic Maggie

Long time no update!

I've been busy with quite a lot of randomness. Among them is that I'm now streaming synthwave and similar music on a live internet radio station. If you'd care to have a listen, try one of the following streams:

* [Ogg Vorbis](https://streams.radiomast.io/3dd94b4d-5756-4685-b03c-e64c9967b850)
* [MP3](https://streams.radiomast.io/92eece62-f8f7-487a-850c-7c985937c353)

Alternatively, have the radio stream provider I'm with seems to have a widget, let's see if that works:

I'm currently streaming this from one of my iMacs, for some reason Mixxx is not happy on it, though. It occasionally crashes in embarrassing ways. 🤷‍♂️ Enjoy it when it's on 😇.

Let me know if you'd like something added to the rota, I do take Bandcamp links - I've kinda nuked my FB and Twitter, but my IG should still work for DMs: https://www.instagram.com/the.effin.maggie/.

Happy Holidays!
