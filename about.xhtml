<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>ef.gy is my personal journal and testing ground for strange ideas and/or unusual concepts. Typically you will find me exploring ideas on how to go back to the way we used to do things, or how to simplify common processes and practices in modern technology. This is because modern technology has a stunning tendency to overcomplicate even the most trivial things, and I find myself loathing most modern trends because of this.</p>
<p>You will also find me ranting a lot about web design. This is because there are a lot of people out there giving terrible advice to novice designers and a lot of idiotic management types believing this stuff. A lot of these seem to mimic practices from print media, and as such they obviously have no place on a non-print medium.</p>

<h1>About the author</h1>
<p>I'm a freelance programmer, currently most often working with smaller software companies in Germany. Purely for prestige reasons I'm also working on my university degree in computer science. My favourite topics include embedded development, formal language theory, minimalistic design and higher dimensional geometry. I'm also occasionally working on little things that bug me. Most of my projects are open source and are either targeted at embedded devices, or related to networking in general and the internet in particular.</p> 
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you'd like to contact me please try to /query me on IRC first. For Skype, please use the instant messenger built into Skype, not the voice chat function. I really don't like getting voice calls.</p>
