<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>ef.gy is a personal journal and testing ground for strange ideas and/or unusual concepts loosely related to IT in all its forms.</p>
<p>Warning: Site may include traces of politics, maths, computer science, handicrafts and possibly even pictures of cute kittens or other wickeningly wute and wuv'ly, dyslexic mammals. YMMV. And make sure your sarcasm detector is turned on and fitted with a fresh set of batteries.</p>

<h1 id="source-code">Source Code</h1>
<p>The sources to this site are available via git, either directly at <em>http://ef.gy/.git</em>, <a href="https://github.com/jyujin/ef.gy">or through GitHub</a>. To browse the sources it'd most likely be best to just head on over to GitHub. To check out the sources you could also use GitHub, or you could download the sources directly off this site like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone http://ef.gy/.git</code></pre>
<p>The site uses a fairly interesting, custom nginx/XSLT-based pseudo-CMS. It sure should come in handy if you don't want to use Apache or PHP for your next blog - or if you're just curious about all the fun things XSLT can be used for. Additional repositories are available at <a href="http://git.becquerel.org/">git.becquerel.org</a> - the repositores there include eINIT and kyuba master repositories and assorted other goodies. The more active ones are also mirrored at GitHub, but see the individual repository notes for mirror information.</p>
<h1>Legalese</h1>
<p>Everyone posting on this site is doing so on their own behalf. If there's trouble, contact Magnus. Try a /query on IRC first, then email. DO NOT CALL ME. I'm serious.</p>
<p>In keeping with the general spirit of 'reusing old tech whenever possible', I'd like to point to <a href="http://gandi.net/whois/details?search=ef.gy">this domain's whois record</a> for any other personal information that I may or may not be required to divulge due to applicable laws.</p>
<p>Further I'd like to point out that any links I've placed on this blog do not point to content I've authored or am otherwise involved with, unless explicitly marked otherwise. All link targets were chosen carefully and scanned for illegal content before being set. If any links do turn out to contain illegal content, please drop me a line and I'll remove them ASAP.</p>
<p>This website uses the <a href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS comment system</a>. This comment system allows you to post anonymously or with your Facebook, Twitter or Google+ account. It will not have your browser contact Facebook or Twitter directly unless you tell it to, although it may inject Google Analytics code. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881">You can opt out of Google Analytics altogether with a browser plugin on the Google website</a>. This site itself does not use Google Analytics or any other method to track users in any way, but it does retain service access logs to guard against malicious entities on the net. Keeping log files is a standard practice on the web, performed by any and all web servers unless explicitly stated otherwise - and then you still can't trust them to not do so.</p>
<p>This site does not use cookies or any other way to retain a user 'session,' although DISQUS may do so. <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy">See their privacy policy for further details</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the way this website was built or any side effects it may have, just contact me and I'm sure we can work something out. <a href="source-code">You may also examine this website's source code</a>, in case you have any technical concerns.</p>
