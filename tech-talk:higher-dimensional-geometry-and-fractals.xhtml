<h1>Good News, Everyone!</h1>
<p>I held my first very own Tech Talk on Friday. Since I got to pick the topic, I chose my favourite: higher-dimensional geometry! I'm fairly pleased with the resulting slides, especially since we did end up identifying two minor glitches in them, which I fixed and which do indicate I didn't end up putting people to sleep over this. So, without further ado, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q7jggzKMCu95BMMPb-9SdGi4Fnt4oBfAKLLkzoD7ILE/pub">here are the slides</a>:</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended. And especially to anyone who asked good questions! :) If you're following along at home, the slides with the big <em>Intermission</em> text on them is where I switched to <a href="https://github.com/ef-gy/topologic">Topologic</a> for some hands-on demonstations.</p>
