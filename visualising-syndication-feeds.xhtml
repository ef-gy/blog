<h1>Oooooh, Shinyyy</h1>
<p>Did I mention that I like a good graph every now and then? I'm sure I did. Here's a pretty one:</p>
<img src="/svg/feed-graph" alt="FEED Database + Graphviz = Fun SVGs"/>
<p>So, how'd that happen? Well, basically, I was trying to come up with new ways to visualise and present syndication feeds - <a href="feed-2">seeing as how I just released the second version of my command line feed reader</a>. As it turns out it's been a really good idea to use SQLite to store all the data it downloads, because that made it really, really easy to rig up <a href="http://git.becquerel.org/?p=jyujin/feed.git;a=blob;f=src/feed-graph;hb=HEAD">a shell script to convert the database's contents to a DOT file and feed it to Graphviz</a>. That pretty picture there is a freshly cleaned database with Slashdot, TheDailyWTF, XKCD and this here blog added as feeds. Turned out quite well, really.</p>
<p>Graphviz is smart enough to allow hyperlinks to be placed in SVG output, meaning you can actually click on the individual entries in the graph. Might come out a bit small though, so click on the "source SVG" link if you want to zoom in a bit. <a href="http://git.becquerel.org/?p=jyujin/feed.git">The script is in FEED's git repository</a>, and will, of course, be included in the next release. Promise ;).</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if I could find a few feeds that cross-reference each other...</p>
