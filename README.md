The site uses a custom pseudo-CMS in XSLT, so reading the sources could actually be useful if you're trying to get a nice site going without Apache or PHP. To download the sources with git, use a command like this one:

    $ git clone http://ef.gy/.git

Alternatively, this site is also mirrored to GitHub, at: https://github.com/jyujin/ef.gy - you can browse the sources or download straight from GitHub.
