A blog on computer science, linear algebra and general awesomeness - may contain traces of crude humour, Britishisms, Kraut nagging, politics or handicrafts. You've been warned.

To read the content of the site on-line just use this link: http://ef.gy/

Download
--------

The site uses a custom pseudo-CMS in XSLT, so reading the sources could actually be useful if you're trying to get a nice site going without Apache or PHP. To download the sources with git, use a command like this one:

    $ git clone http://ef.gy/.git

Alternatively, this site is also mirrored to GitHub, at: https://github.com/jyujin/ef.gy - you can browse the sources or download straight from GitHub.
