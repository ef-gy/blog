<h1>Get this Website's Source Code</h1>
<p>Unlike some other authors, I really think people should have access to the source code of everything they use. In order to set a good example for this, I'm releasing the source code for this web site under an MIT/X style licence, like I do with all my programmes. To get access to the source code, all you need to do is clone its repository (at http://ef.gy/.git) with the GIT tool. If you're using a UNIX-like operating system, you probably have this tool installed by default and can issue the following command in a shell:</p>
<code>$ git clone http://ef.gy/.git</code>
<p>This will create a new directory called "ef.gy" and check out the current source code for this website into this directory. If you're not on a UNIX-y machine at the moment, or you'd rather not use the command line, just hit Google for a "GIT client" and use that. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Note that, in order to actually use the source code, you are bound by the licence agreement in the COPYING file. You do not necessarily need to agree to the terms in this file, but this is the only thing that would allow you to use the source in any way.</p>
