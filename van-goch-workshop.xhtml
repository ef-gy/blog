<h1>That Was Fun</h1>
<p>So, Sarah just sent us an email earlier that the pictures we drew at our Amsterdam company outing arrived in the mail. I was with the Van Goch group and came up with this:</p>
<img src="/jpeg/van-goch-workshop" alt="This is the picture I drew at the Van Goch workshop at our Amsterdam outing."/>
<p>The idea was to draw a still life in a style similar to Van Goch's. We used acrylic instead of oil paint, but it still worked out pretty well. I think I nailed the flow and motion aspects, but I didn't really manage to do the impressionist dot thingy. Still, I like how that turned out, given that we only had one and a half hour to draw and it was my first time using acrylic paint. Oh yeah: 1 Bonus Internets to anyone who can figure out what I drew. Pro tip: it ain't sunflowers :P.</p>
