That, and our plans for world domination, of course. ITT: Details on wtf is going on, wtf this is all about and wtf it's good for.</p><p>As some of you may be aware of, after that particular incident with an ex-developer, and the issue with the domainname, einit has been abandoned in favour of a complete rewrite and redesign, which has been dubbed 'kyuba'. In order to implement kyuba, the consensus on #kyuba and #einit was to start from scratch real good like, so i started on a project called the 'atomic-libc', which has since been renamed 'curie'. Curie is basically a libc replacement with just the features that will be needed for kyuba; i.e. just enough to make it usable for just about anything, but completely minimalistic, with the goal to try and make super-small binaries as well as theoretically being easily portable, even to a non-hosted environment. In the meantime, dev9 sparked more interested, and the design was vaguely fleshed out. To implement dev9, which will be sort of a udev-/devfs-crossover for linux, i've started on another library, dubbed 'duat'. Duat will eventually also include support for other protocols but 9p2000 and 9p2000.u, but not just now.</p><p>Onwards, to the status report! People may be glad to hear that releases of curie-2 as well as duat-1 are underway. Neither will have top-notch documentation just yet, but I've been told that the testcases for curie are fairly extensive and double as solid examples for how to use the lib. The current version of libcurie is completely self-sustained on linux/amd64 and linux/ppc, and on all other architectures it should work fine as it will simply wrap around any installed posix libc. As a nice highlight for curie-2, i've been able to somewhat get C++ apps working on linux with curie, so i added a 'libcurie++' to the pack, which wraps around some of the constructs in libcurie. On linux/amd64 and linux/ppc, both C and C++ binaries linked with curie or curie++ end up easily being under 30k, statically linked, which is precisely the thing we've been looking for. (Well, on the downside, on all other archs you get binaries of just about the same size, except that they still link against libc, so nothing's lost but nothing's won either, save for the saner interface and goodies in curie).</p><p>Duat-1 will support both 9p2000 and 9p2000.u, i've just committed some code that should make the lib conform to the 9p2000.u specs. It even has support for wstat ;). (No offence really, i love libixp.)</p><p>Right after both curie-2 and duat-1 have been released, i will start to work on dev9 (yes, we still haven't arrived at kyuba just yet). This means that both kyuba and einit are currently on ice... however, einit-0.40.0, as well as the git 'testing' branch are reported to work very well for people, with a number of minor glitches still occuring, none of which seem critical. This means that if you want fast bootup, now, just use einit-0.40.0 or the git testing branch version. We'll even still try to help ya on #kyuba. Or #einit... although #kyuba would be better ;).</p><p>That is all, Magnus</p></body></html></content><category term="Blog Post"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>

I will say that git-testing has been working for me for well over 6 months without problems at all, and I'm running a relatively old machine. If you have issues with einit-0.40.0 only reaching ~80% on boot up, random lock ups or reboots, come talk, as I think git-testing fixes these issues.

Second, the v9fs patch i wrote has been accepted, so you might be able to use dev9 with the next coolest linux version. Or maybe in two version. Either way, it's coming.</p><p>Codex is dedicated to bring you a host of things of great awesomeness, such as libfreevec, which is a truly free (as in LGPL) library providing you with heavily optimised replacements for C functions. And by heavily optimised, I really mean it, and since you can all see the bootcharts of my good ol' eINIT, you do know that I'm not easily convinced that things are properly optimised, don't you?</p><p>So what are you waiting for, go get to their website at http://codex.gr/ -- you know you want to!</p><p>As for the v9fs patch: it has been accepted by the v9fs author, which is a pretty good sign for it. That hopefully means that dev9 will soon work with a vanilla kernel. Talk about awesome.</p><p>Anyway, bedtime for nasty kittens. Be good</p><hr/><p>Magnus</p></body></html></content><category term="Blog Post"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>

People wonder why oh why I would have started Curie. A lot of it is..."/><meta name="category" content="Blog Post"/></head><body><p>This particular question seems to have come up a lot lately, on IRC as well as other places. People wonder why oh why I would have started Curie. A lot of it is along the lines of "why didn't you use one of the glibc alternatives?" and "ZOMG THE WHEEL IS BEING REINVENTED AGAIN!?". I'll try to point out why not only was it not possible to use "an alternate libc", but also why the whole notion of that sort of question is both pointless and meaningless in this context. In a nutshell: Curie is NOT simply a clone of glibc, or any other libc for that matter!</p><p>At its very core, Curie is meant to be a library that faciliates input, output and some primitive form of green threading and s-expression parsing/generation. On the vast majority of platforms and architectures, it does so by actively using the host libc; be that glibc, uclibc, newlib, dietlibc, or whatever else came with the operating system. This was the first step of implementing Curie. The reason to implement this at all was that I/O in C is generally either tedious (check for errors after each call, lots of casting things around, half the time with helper functions, etc etc whatever), or error-prone (think of the vast amount of exploits based on the *printf() class of functions; if you can't remember any, do some research before reading on) and conceptually designed to work with files/fifos/etc in blocking mode. The first two obviously warrant a wrapper/convenience library, and the latter one is a sure killer for green threading (which proved to be far superious performance-wise for our purposes in the late stages of eINIT's development).</p><p>So in essence, Curie is really just a wrapper library around a regular libc. Care has been taken to avoid naming collisions between POSIX and curie, and if you give it a thorough look then Curie turns out to be kind of a cross between libevent, an s-expression I/O library and some convenience functions for launching programmes.</p><p>However, it was clear from the very start that Curie was only going to use a very minimal set of system calls. Since the other design goal of Kyuba, and thus Curie, was a small memory and disk footprint due to the primary target platform being embedded devices, it was obvious that it would be beneficial to just wrap those system calls up in a tiny bit of assembly and thus obsolete the libc. This part needs to be done for each and every target platform, but it's really quite a trivial task and completely optional. That's why there's no curie "port" for linux/x86 (yet): no need to, it works fine without the port (only the memory footprint is about half a megabyte bigger compared to linux/powerpc and linux/amd64), none of the dev team actualy HAS a properly set up x86 linux system and it's unlikely to be used in embedded, so why bother. (and, of course, x86 assembly makes me puke and wonder why the fuck a retarded, hack-/patchfest architecture like that ever got popular in the first place.)</p><p>In summary: Curie is just a wrapper library, like any other such library that at least half the open source projects on this planet write for themselves, designed in a way that makes it trivially easy to "detach" it from the "required" libc and wrapped up in a stand alone library in case it might save some other projects with similar goals the trouble of writing their own. If you're still thinking "why didn't he use uclibc/dietlibc/yourfavouritetinylibc?", then it's pretty obvious that you haven't figured out what Curie is, and what it's supposed to do. For that matter, the C library to use isn't a programme or programme developer's choice to begin with, it's a choice that the operating sytem vendor/distributor/user makes.</p></body></html></content><category term="Blog Post"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>

Part of this is a (purely functional) script interpreter, which coincidentally is also the first (and currently only) implemented part of the library. The script interpreter is nothing fancy, and it'll probably choke on even medium workloads, but for simple things like shell scripting it should be suited just fine.</p></body></html></content><category term="Project Description"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>

This blog entry was long overdue, but we all know what they say about things that're long overdue ;D. Every now and again on IRC, there's people who'd like to try all of our stuff as it is right now. Even though there's not much to do at the moment, this does kinda help with finding bugs, so I'll try to summarise how to build the tools. (This is just a quick summary, real docs for building will follow at a later stage. It may sound elitist, but you really should be somewhat good with low-level programming issues to do this right now, thus the docs are a bit fuzzy compared to what I'd usually produce.)</p><p>First of all, you need curie for just about every other project in the kyuba dirs. Now, which version of curie you need may depend, as there's still things being added to curie. To build any of the projects you need icemake, which is part of the curie repository (curie is also built using icemake, we'll get to how that works in a minute). To build any of the projects, you need to check out their repository using the GIT tool, or get their release tarball using your webbrowser or wget. The release tarballs are all linked from the top project pages here on kyuba.org, so you shouldn't have trouble getting those.</p><p>Building projects is easy: get on the command line and use the icemake programme in the source directory: cd path/to/sources icemake</p><p>To install things, use: icemake -id path/to/install/to</p><p>There's some options to control icemake (especially the install layout); use icemake --help to see those options. the -f option might be useful for installing. If you cross-compile, you might want to make a habit of specifying the target directory (-d path/to/install/to, along with the layout option you used to install) on the compile command line, as this may allow icemake to use some previously installed headers and libraries.</p><p>To build curie without a prebuilt binary for icemake, you'd use "./build.sh" instead of "icemake" in those command lines. If the massive output ends up annoying you, use "ice" instead of "icemake" (only works on linux). (ice will print a simple progress bar instead of the tons of other output icemake produces). On windows, if you dont have a prebuilt icemake, use "build.cmd" (or simply "build"). You should still do it from the command line though, especially for msvc++ since you need to use the msvc++ build console for the paths to be set up properly...</p><p>The library dependencies for the different (main) projects are currently as follows:</p><ul><li>curie, icemake: no deps (obviously)</li><li>duat-6: curie-8 (newer versions will not work)</li><li>duat-git: curie-10 (or newer)</li><li>seteh-git: curie-git (10 could work too)</li><li>dev9: duat-git and curie-10 or newer (only use the git version of dev9, and even those dont always work)</li><li>kyuba-1: curie-8 and duat-6 (nothing newer)</li><li>kyuba-git: curie-git and seteh-git</li></ul><p>You also need a C compiler supported by icemake; currently supported are:</p><ul><li>GCC (linux/x86-32, linux/x86-64, linux/powerpc-32, windows/x86-32; should also work on linux/arm and darwin/powerpc)</li><li>Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 (windows/x86-32 and windows/x86-64)</li><li>Borland C++ Builder 2006 (windows/x86-32)</li></ul><p>The compiler binaries need to be in the PATH environment variable, otherwise icemake will spew out errors.</p><p>If you want to try things on windows, you really should use the ms vc++ compiler. It kinda hurts to say it, but their compiler's pretty fucking good except for their complete lack of C99 support. It's free to download and use for private as well as commercial use too. If you want reasonable warning messages however, you should give borland's compiler a go, their warnings are pretty useful (especially the "initialised but never used" type of errors). I believe the 2006 version is available for free on their website as well as "Turbo C++ 2006" or something.</p><p>Another note on icemake: The versions in the curie-9 and curie-10 releases are somewhat bugged, use the git version if it has random hissyfits!</p><p>As always, questions tend to find swift answers on IRC, on freenode #kyuba.</p></body></html></content><category term="Blog Post"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>

Shame about the domain, but can't be helped now. I had already bought this new domain a wee bit earlier for a different project so I'm putting it to use for both of them now. The old jyujin.de server got killed too, which means the layman overlay has moved as well. For that to work again just issue "layman -d jyujin &amp;&amp; layman -a jyujin" on a console and you should be golden. And for all you guys out there with acute cases of nominal aphasia or dyslexia, it's spelled BE-C-Q-U-E-REL. Like the SI unit. Oh and, Curie-11 is still in the making. Do drop by on IRC for shits 'n giggles. This was your host speaking; over and out.&lt;!--break--&gt;</p></body></html></content><category term="Blog Post"/><category term="kyuba.org"/></entry>
