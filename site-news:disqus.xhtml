<h1>I Caved</h1>
<p>Back when I was designing this website, I thought to myself "hey, I don't really need a comment system". So I didn't build one - which sure made the whole thing about not using a CMS and going with plain XSLT a whole damn lot easier. But I've been thinking, sometimes those comments are pretty damn handy. At least with high profile articles like <a href="/statistics:ssd-write-endurance">the one on SSD write endurance</a>, <a href="using-nginx-as-a-proxy-server">the one on that tells you how to configure your nginx as a forward proxy with transparent XSLT transforms</a>, or even <a href="/sql:markov-chains">the one about Markov Chains in pure SQL(ite)</a>. I sure got a lot of emails and Facebook messages about those, so I figure proper comments might be in order. So now the pages look like this:</p>
<img src="/png/disqus" alt="DISQUS comments are now enabled on all articles"/>
<p>So yeah, I caved: As of right now I'm adding <a href="http://disqus.com/">the DISQUS comments plugin</a> to the website. I've looked around a bit, and this one certainly seemed the sanest - in particular it won't have your browser call back to Facebook or Twitter unless you tell it to; and apparently it's even designed to work well with screen readers. Plus it won't clog down the page loading unnecessarily like certain other plugins. <a href="about">See the about page for some additional notes on what this plugin may or may not do</a>.</p>
